Welcome! My name is Yue, and I am a senior at the School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China.

My undergraduate research focuses on silicon photonic device design (under the guidance of Prof. Xiaoyong Hu, Peking University), photonic quantum computing and quantum algorithm (under the guidance of Prof. Jianwei Wang). Currently I'm also interested in coherent transducer between optical and microwave photon (which is also what I'm doing now in Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini's lab ).

For more details about my research experience and interests, feel free to look at my Research page to learn more!
