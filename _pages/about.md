**Welcome! My name is Yue, and I am a senior at the School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China.**

My undergraduate research focuses on **silicon photonic device design, photonic quantum computing and quantum algorithm**. Currently I'm also interested in coherent **building quantum transducer between optical and microwave photon** (which is also what I'm doing now in Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini's lab ).
