**Welcome! My name is Yue, and I am a senior at the School of Physics, Peking University (PKU), Beijing, China.**

I have already spent 3 enriching years in PKU. During my studies there, I discovered my interest in classical and quantum photonic devices. My first research experience is in Prof. Xiaoyong Hu's lab where I have gained the basic knowledge for classical silicon photonics device and participated in a project aiming to inversely design photnoic device with the assistance of machine learning and other advanced algorithm.

In the summer of 2021, I joined Prof. Jianwei Wang's lab where I focused on integrated quantum photnic chip (linear quantum computing) and quantum simulation. For my first project, I worked on quantum simulation algorithm demonstration with quantum photonic chip. I am very grateful to Prof. Jianwei Wang for providing me with valuable research opportunities in fields that I have never touched before.

**Currently, I am participating in VURP (Visiting Undergraduate Research Program) at Caltech and conducting research in Prof. Mohammad Mirhosseini's QElab**. My research here mainly focus on building coherent transducer between microwave photons and optical photons (also known as quantum transducer). Thanks to the enthusiasm of the graduate students in the lab, I enjoy my summer in Pasadena very much.
